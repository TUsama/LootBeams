###V1.2.6
1. Completely refactor the code, including 
    * Loot Beam:
      1) Add IBeamColorSource and related event, allowing other developers to register their own IBeamColorSource for better color control.
      2) Delete NBT compat, any developer should never use this tbh.
        
    * Tooltip:
      1) remove related feature because this should be a standalone mod.
